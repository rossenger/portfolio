            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p>As part of our UX/UI design boot camp, our team was tasked with redesigning a non-profit organization's website. We were given 3 weeks to complete this design challenge.</p>
            <p>Our team selected the White Bear Area Food Shelf website to redesign, and our goal was to improve its usability and informational hierarchy to better serve the mission of eliminating food insecurity in the White Bear area.</p>
            <p>After creating a responsive website redesign for the White Bear Area Food shelf, we presented our design process to our boot camp cohort and supported our findings and final prototypes with the following deliverables: proto-persona, UX research interview plan, Google Survey findings, brainstorming and feature prioritization matrix, user scenario, journey map, heuristic evaluation, user flow, low fidelity wireframes and prototypes, usability testing plan and findings, style guide, medium-fidelity wireframes and prototypes, style guide, and high-fidelity prototypes.</p>
